NodeDB is an implementation of a set of concepts that are written in CONCEPTS. The concepts are mostly borrowed from [Drupal](http://drupal.org), Graph databases and traditional Object Oriented Programming implementations. 
The implementation is done in Javascript, targetted on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), although it should work on every JavaScript supporting [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/). It requires the [Underscore](http://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/) library.
